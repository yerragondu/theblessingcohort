        The Blessing CoHort exists to walk alongside pastors serving in
        unreached and underdeveloped places. We believe the Gospel spreads most
        faithfully when pastors are strengthened, churches are built, and
        communities are transformed.

    <!-- ================= ORIGIN STORY ================= -->
    <section class="section origin">
      <div class="origin-content">
        <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
        <p>
          This mission did not begin with a detailed plan, funding, or clarity.
          It began with a simple desire to support pastors - and a clear
          direction from God to go to villages. The calling was not toward towns
          or cities, but toward unreached places - forests, rural villages,
          tribal and remote regions. In obedience, we stepped into these places,
          trusting God to lead each step.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we initially understood as simple financial support slowly
          unfolded into something much larger. As the mission was discussed,
          prayed over, and tested, it became clear that this work was about
          strengthening the Church itself - beginning with pastors who are
          already faithfully serving. Wise counsel helped us move forward
          carefully and take steps with discernment and accountability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way, God made it clear that discernment would be required -
          that not everyone who appears to serve does so with the right heart.
          Yet He assured us that He would guard the work, reminding us that
          while there may be wolves among the flock, He Himself would deal with
          them as we moved forward in trust and obedience. Trusting God for
          provision, protection, and guidance, we stepped forward - learning,
          listening, and allowing the vision to unfold as He leads.

      <div class="pillars">
        <div class="pillar">
          <h3>Strengthening Pastors</h3>
          <p>
            Pastors in unreached and remote places often serve faithfully
            without consistent support. We stand with them so they can focus on
            prayer, discipleship, and the calling God has given them.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
          <h3>Building Strong Churches</h3>
          <p>
            When pastors are strengthened, local churches grow healthy and
            stable-becoming centers of faith, discipleship, and hope within
            their villages.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="pillar">
          <h3>Transforming Communities</h3>
          <p>
            As churches are strengthened, the Gospel naturally flows into the
            surrounding community-bringing spiritual growth and lasting
            transformation.
